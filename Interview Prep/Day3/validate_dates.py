# Validate Dates in a String
#
# Description: Youâ€™re given a text file dates.txt containing dates in the format DD-MM-YYYY, one per line.
# Write a Python script to read the file and print only the valid dates. A date is valid if:
#
#     Day is between 1 and 31 (assume all months have 31 days for simplicity).
#     Month is between 1 and 12.
#     Year is between 1900 and 2099. Handle invalid formats or values gracefully.
